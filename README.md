# Introduction to (Deep) Reinforcement Learning
Here are the exercises for the first/second session of our RL course.

## Requirements
Create a virtual environment, with python or conda, e.g.
```buildoutcfg
conda create -n rl python=3.10
conda activate rl
```
Then, update your pip!
```buildoutcfg
pip install --upgrade pip
```
Clone the repository and get into RL-course-DSR. Now you can install the required
packages which are listed in ```requirements.txt```, for example
by
```buildoutcfg
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
