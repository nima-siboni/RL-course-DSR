# In this code the optimal policy is found for:
# for an agent finding the path to destination.

# Dynamic programming is used find the optimal values and policy with the notations in chapter 4 of THE book.
# The book: Reinforcement learning (introduction) by Sutton & Batto, second edition.

# the program is structured as:
# 1. initialization
# 2. policy evaluation, just for fun of it!
# 3. policy iteration
# 4. printing and saving

# 1. Initialization
# 1.1 inputs and the random seed
np.random.seed(0)

# grid size along each direction
n = 10

# 1.2 policy $\pi$
# setting policy to a random policy
pi = np.random.random_integers(low=0, high=4, size=(n, n))
print(pi)
np.savetxt('original_pi.dat', pi)

# 1.3 values, v
# setting all to zero
v = np.zeros(shape=(n, n))

# 1.4 reward
# all points except (n-1, n-1) have negative reawrds
# the obstacles get larger negative rewards

# 1.5 discount
# should be set to a value smaller than 1
gamma = 0.99


# 1.6 setting up the plot
ax = create_plot(n)
plt.ion()

# 2. policy evaluation #
# Eq. (4.5) of the book.

# this part is only executed if you want to find out what are values of the random initial policies

# this can be replaced by a measure of convergence

# values are set to zero.
